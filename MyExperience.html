<h1>My Experience Here in Madison Park</h1>
<hr>
<p>So far my experience here in Madison Park has been good to say the least. Even though about half of those 4 years we're taken over by Corona, it was still a pretty descent experience. During the beginning of my freshman year, I was nervous because I was fresh outta middle school and not only that, I was entering into a big high school. Madison is not your average sized school that's for sure. I would say after the first month, that's when I officialy became comfortable with the school. When I started my first day during the freshman exploratory period here in CPWD in October 2018, it was a pretty cool experience. We did written assignments here and there but we also did some hands-on work. Like making robot cars and learning how to operate them. Later on throughout my freshmen year and some of sophomore year, we also went on a few field trips around the city and visited a couple of local computer companies in Boston. It was quite interesting and fun. We saw it for ourselves what it was like. It was a very business/work like environment. We saw the inside and the outside of the buildings, it was nice. Throughout my years in CPWD, there were lots of topics that we discussed. We got into topics like SDLC, NFT's, Computational Thinking, Datasets, etc. Overall CPWD has been a pretty awesome class and I'm glad I am a part of it.</p>
<p>With this portfolio of mine. I wanted this to be unique, so I made different pages scattered throughout the portfolio so that way everything won't be in the same page.</p>
