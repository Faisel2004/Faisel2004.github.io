<h1>My Experience Here in Madison Park</h1>
<hr>
<p>So far my experience here in Madison Park has been good to say the least. Even though about half of those 4 years we're taken over by Corona, it was still a pretty descent experience. During the beginning of my freshman year, I was nervous because I was fresh outta middle school and not only that, I was entering into a big high school. Madison is not your average sized school that's for sure. I would say after the first month, that's when I officially became comfortable with the school. When I started my first day during the freshman exploratory period here in CPWD in October 2018, it was a pretty cool experience. We did written assignments here and there but we also did some hands-on work. Like making robot cars and learning how to operate them. Later on throughout my freshmen year and some of sophomore year, we also went on a few field trips around the city and visited a couple of local computer companies in Boston. It was quite interesting and fun. We saw it for ourselves what it was like. It was a very business/work like environment. We saw the inside and the outside of the buildings, it was nice. Throughout my years in CPWD, there were lots of topics that we discussed. We got into topics like SDLC, NFT's, Computational Thinking, Datasets, etc. Overall CPWD has been a pretty awesome class. And I'm glad I am a part of it.</p>
<p>With this portfolio of mine. I wanted this to be unique, so I made different pages scattered throughout the portfolio so that way everything won't be in the same page. I added some style to every single page with a nice navigation bar. My home page looks pretty good with a nice neon background image as well as a marvelous nav bar. In terms of the content I did 8 pages. The first one was a page about my past work. I had 3 different assignments on there and it's all old HTML assignments. Another one I have is my Resume, which has some info about myself and the jobs I worked at in the past. Another one is my reflection paper, which is this one.  Another page I have is called CSS_Explained, which is a basic concept/introduction based on CSS. There's also one page I have which is called SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle). And I basically touch on the 6 phases of SDLC and overall just touch on that subject. The next pages are Python pages. It consists of two pages, one is just a introduction to Python and the other page is more advanced. And finally my last page is my interests, which is basically about what I've getting into the past year and my plans for the future after I graduate. So yeah those are my 8 pages which I compiled together to make my portfolio.</p>
<p>Throughout my 4 years here in Madison in this vocation. I learned about HTML/CSS, Python, SDLC, a little bit of JavaScript & Bootstrap. What I mainly learned is that when it comes to coding, you HAVE to take your time. Develop strategies and looking over the code and testing it. That’s VERY important indeed. As long as you build patience, practice coding, get the basics right, balance your learning, and learn the algorithms you should be fine. And those are the things I will definitely take me into the real world.</p>
<p>I just wanted to say thank you Mr.Berger for these 4 years. You have been a nice and great vocational teacher to me and other students as well.(Mr.Bastarache was nice too but if you weren’t there, he would’ve been more mean & strict lolXD). Your a really kind teacher. There was some days where I was doing some assignments and I gave up because I struggling on them but you still encouraged me to get it done. You even helped me on them. To be honest, your the nicest teacher I ever met in my whole life. You would buy us food sometimes from the bakery. Pizza on some other days. You even took us on a couple field trips! I can’t forget those field trips we were on. They were fun! Thank you as well Osa for the snacks and the days I stayed after school for getting Domino’s and overall just being a funny & chill teacher. And! I also can't forget that bowling trip we had yesterday!! I had a very fun time, the food was good as well! Once again, thank you so much for all the things you do(Mr.Bastarache & Osa as well) I hope you continue to teach a little longer for the years to come. Thank you all for everything.</p>
