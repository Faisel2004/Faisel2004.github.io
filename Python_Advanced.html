<h1>Python Advanced</h1>
<hr>
<p>Coding doesn't always come easy. That's why a lot of programmers tend to go the easy route and copy and paste code or just take shortcuts in general. Unlike HTML Python is a little more complex. Remember, Python is more based off of variables and functions. Numbers are extremely common in programming. They are used to represent things like screen size dimensions, geographic locations, money and points, the amount of time that passes in a video, positions of game avatars, and colors through assigning numeric codes. Being able to effectively perform mathematical operations in programming is an important skill to develop because of how frequently you’ll be working with numbers. Though a high-level understanding of mathematics can certainly help you become a better programmer, it is not a prerequisite. If you don’t have a background in mathematics, try to think of math as a tool to accomplish what you would like to achieve, and as a way to improve your logical and/or computational thinking. The two most used numeric types in Python are integers and floats. Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or 0 (…, -1, 0, 1, …). Floats are real numbers, they contain a decimal point (as in 9.0 or -2.25). Here's another concept about Python, Lists & Arrays.
    Python array and lists are the important data structure of Python. Both list and array are used to store the data in Python. These data structures allow us to indexing, slicing, and iterating. But they have little dissimilarity with each other.There's also another concept you have is Control Structures. Control structures are the blocks that analyze variables and choose directions in which to go based on given parameters. The basic Control Structures in programming languages are: Conditionals (or Selection): which are used to execute one or more statements if a condition is met. There are 3 kinds of control structures which are Conditional Branches, which we use for choosing between two or more paths. Loops that are used to iterate through multiple values/objects and repeatedly run specific code blocks. Branching Statements, which are used to alter the flow of control in loops. Fun fact Python first released back in February 20th 1991! It was created by this guy named Guido Van Rossum who is a Dutch programmer. He began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020. As of now, he’s retired and no longer continuing his coding career.</p>
