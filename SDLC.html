<p>First of all what is SDLC and what does it stand for? SDLC, which stands for Software Development Life Cycle is a process that produces software with the highest quality and at the lowest cost in the shortest time possible. SDLC provides a well-structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high-quality software which is well-tested and ready for production use. There are 6 Phases when it comes to this. The first stage is identifying the current problems or Requirement Analysis. “What are the current problems?” This stage of the SDLC means getting input from all stakeholders, including customers, salespeople, industry experts, and programmers. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of the current system with improvement as the goal. Stage two is Planning. “What do we want?” In this stage of the SDLC, the team determines the cost and resources required for implementing the analyzed requirements. It also details the risks involved and provides sub-plans for softening those risks. In other words, the team should determine the feasibility of the project and how they can implement the project successfully with the lowest risk in mind. Third stage is Designing. “How will we get what we want?” This phase of the SDLC starts by turning the software specifications into a design plan called the Design Specification. All stakeholders then review this plan and offer feedback and suggestions. It’s crucial to have a plan for collecting and incorporating stakeholder input into this document. Failure at this stage will almost certainly result in cost overruns at best and the total collapse of the project at worst. Fourth is Building. This when we really start putting things into action. “Let’s create what we want.” At this stage, the actual development starts. It’s important that every developer sticks to the agreed blueprint. Also, make sure you have proper guidelines in place about the code style and practices. Fifth is testing the code.“Did we get what we want?” In this stage, we test for defects and deficiencies. We fix those issues until the product meets the original specifications. And finally, stage six Software Development. “Let’s start using what we got.”At this stage, the goal is to deploy the software to the production environment so users can start using the product. However, many organizations choose to move the product through different deployment environments such as a testing or staging environment. This allows any stakeholders to safely play with the product before releasing it to the market. Besides, this allows any final mistakes to be caught before releasing the product. In short, we want to verify if the code meets the defined requirements.
