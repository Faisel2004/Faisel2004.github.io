<h1>My Interests</h1>
<hr>
<p>Throughout my life I always had an interest towards technology. When I was younger, I used to play a lot of computer games. Then I switched to video games in middle school:). Anyway, when I was also in middle school, I use be in a tech program that deals with robotics and coding. When I was in elementary, I used to play some coding games. Anyway that's a little backstory of my life. Throughout this year, I became a part of a early college program called RoxMapp. Shoutout to DeGrace by the way:). The college I chose was Bunker Hill Community College. I've been taking college classes for free because of it! I only had to go to school for my vocation, NO regular classes at all. Since I got good/descent grades from my college classes, I'm getting a boost because each class is worth 3 credits! So overall when I graduate, I expect to have around 18-27 credits in total! Cause I took 9 classes so that's a big boost! After I graduate, I am almost positive I will continue to take classes at Bunker Hill plan on getting an associates degree or a certification in Computer Programming. I also plan on studying business and possibly music. Then after I graduate or get a certification, I'll find a good-paying job or something figured out by then. Those are my interests. </p>
